I've used ChatGPT Plus for 6 months.

Here's the truth:

WORTH IT IF:
✅ You use AI 5+ times per day
✅ Speed matters (it's 3x faster)
✅ You need latest features first
✅ Image generation is useful to you

NOT WORTH IT IF:
❌ Casual user (few times per week)
❌ The free version works fine
❌ You don't need plugins

My verdict: Worth it for professionals.

Currently saves me 2 hrs/day = $20 is nothing.
