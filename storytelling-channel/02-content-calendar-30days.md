# 30-Day Content Calendar - Faceless Storytelling Channel

## 📋 How to Use This Calendar

1. **Research First**: Spend 2 hours finding and verifying sources for all 30 stories
2. **Batch Scripts**: Write all 30 scripts before creating any videos
3. **Batch Create**: Create all Week 1 content (21 reels) in one 4-hour session
4. **Schedule**: Use Meta Business Suite for automated posting

**Key Difference from AI Channel**: Stories require more research but less ongoing creativity. You're retelling existing narratives, not creating original insights.

## Week 1: Establishing Your Style

### Day 1 - Story #1 (7 AM)
**Category**: Historical Mystery  
**Title**: "The Library of Alexandria: What Really Happened"  
**Hook**: "The greatest library in history burned down... or did it?"

**Script** (60 seconds):
```
In 48 BC, Julius Caesar's forces set fire to Alexandria's harbor.

The flames spread.

And humanity lost 400,000 scrolls—the sum of all human knowledge.

Or so the story goes.

But historians now believe this is wrong.

The library didn't burn in a single day.

It died slowly over centuries.

Neglect. Funding cuts. Political instability.

The final scrolls? Likely burned by religious zealots in 391 AD.

What was lost? 
- How to make Greek fire
- The cure to ancient diseases  
- Maps of undiscovered continents

We'll never know what we lost.

Some scrolls still exist—hidden in private collections.

Maybe you've walked past one at an estate sale.

Part 2: The scrolls that DID survive → tomorrow

Follow for more hidden history 📚
```

**Visuals**:
- Ancient library footage (Canva stock)
- Scrolls unrolling
- Fire imagery (tasteful, not overly dramatic)
- Map animations
- Sepia color grade

**Music**: Mysterious orchestral, building tension

**Sources**: 
- Britannica article on Library of Alexandria
- History.com article
- Academic paper (link in comments)

### Day 1 - Story #2 (1 PM)
**Category**: True Crime  
**Title**: "The Nurse Who Fooled Everyone"

**Hook**: "She saved hundreds of lives. Then they realized she'd ended dozens more."

**Script**:
```
Genene Jones was the best nurse in the ICU.

When babies started coding, she was always there first.

Reviving them. Saving them. A hero.

For 2 years, she saved over 60 babies.

Then one doctor noticed a pattern.

Babies only coded during HER shifts.

They investigated.

What they found was horrifying.

She was injecting them with drugs to induce cardiac arrest...

Then "saving" them to look like a hero.

Not all of them survived.

She's now serving life in prison.

60 attempted murders.
15 confirmed deaths.
Potentially hundreds more.

The scariest part?

It took 2 years for anyone to notice.

Trust, but verify.
Even the heroes.

What would you do if you noticed this pattern? 
Comment below 👇
```

**Visuals**:
- Hospital corridor stock footage
- Medical equipment (not graphic)
- Nurse silhouette (respectful, not showing real person)
- Newspaper clippings
- Cold blue color grade

**Music**: Dark ambient, tension-building

**Ethics Note**: Stick to facts, no speculation, respect victims

### Day 1 - Story #3 (9 PM - PRIME TIME)
**Category**: Unexplained Phenomena  
**Title**: "The Hum Only 2% of People Can Hear"

**Hook**: "There's a sound. You might hear it right now. Scientists can't explain it."

**Script**:
```
It started in the 1970s.

People in Taos, New Mexico reported hearing a low humming sound.

24/7. Inescapable.

Only 2% of the population can hear it.

Scientists came. Set up equipment. Measured everything.

Result: Nothing. No sound detected.

But the people who hear it? 
Lives ruined. Can't sleep. Can't concentrate.

Some moved across the country.

The hum followed them.

Now it's been reported in:
- Bristol, UK
- Bondi, Australia  
- Windsor, Canada
- Kokomo, Indiana

Theories:
- Military equipment?
- Geological activity?
- Mass hallucination?
- Tinnitus variation?

None have been proven.

The hum continues.

Do YOU hear a low humming sound right now?

Comment "I hear it" or "Silence" 👇
```

**Visuals**:
- Sound wave animations
- Map with locations marked
- Person holding head (frustrated but not overdramatic)
- Frequency visualizers
- Dark, mysterious color grade

**Music**: Low drone in background (meta: use the "hum" as music)

**Engagement**: Will get massive comments testing if they hear it
