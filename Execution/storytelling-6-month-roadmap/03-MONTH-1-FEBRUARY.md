## 🚨 Month 1 Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge #1: "First week views are low (100-500/reel)"
**Solution**: NORMAL. Algorithm is learning. Keep posting. Week 2-3 will improve.

### Challenge #2: "I'm running out of time"
**Solution**: Reduce frequency temporarily to 2x/day. Quality > Quantity.

### Challenge #3: "One story type performs WAY better"
**Solution**: GREAT! Double down on it. 70-80% of content = winner.

### Challenge #4: "I got a copyright claim on music"
**Solution**: Only use copyright-free music (Epidemic, Artlist, YouTube Audio). Remove claimed post.

### Challenge #5: "Engagement dropped after Week 2"
**Solution**: Increase engagement actions (reply faster, engage more with others). Hook might be getting weak - refresh.
