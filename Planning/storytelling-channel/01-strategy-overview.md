## 🎭 Storytelling Formula

### The 7-Point Story Structure (For 60-second Reels)

**1. Hook (0-2 seconds)**: Mind-blowing opening
> "In 1997, a man woke up with no memory of who he was..."

**2. Setup (3-10 seconds)**: Establish context
> "His name was Benjamin Kyle. No wallet, no ID, nothing."

**3. Rising Action (11-30 seconds)**: Build tension
> "For 11 years, no one could identify him. Face recognition: nothing. Missing persons: nothing."

**4. Twist/Complication (31-40 seconds)**: Unexpected turn
> "Then a genealogy test revealed something shocking..."

**5. Climax (41-50 seconds)**: Peak moment
> "He discovered his real identity... and why he had been erased."

**6. Resolution (51-55 seconds)**: Payoff
> "Turns out, he had witnessed something he shouldn't have."

**7. Final Hook (56-60 seconds)**: Leave them wanting more
> "The full story is in the comments 👇 You won't believe part 2..."

### Alternative: The Cliffhanger Loop
- Part 1: Setup mystery, end mid-story
- Part 2: Resolution + new mystery
- Creates series, encourages follows

## 🎵 Audio Strategy

### Voiceover Strategy

## 🚀 Growth Tactics (Storytelling-Specific)

### Tactic 1: The Series Strategy
**Create connected stories**:
- "Unsolved Mysteries Monday" series
- "Famous Last Words Friday" series
- Each episode builds anticipation

### Tactic 2: Cliffhanger Endings
**Never fully resolve in one reel**:
> "But that's not even the strangest part... 
> Part 2 tomorrow → Follow so you don't miss it"

**Result**: Forces follows to see resolution

### Tactic 3: Comment Section Gold
**Hide key details in comments**:
> "The full explanation is too crazy for one video.
> Check pinned comment for the shocking truth 👇"

**Result**: Boosts engagement, increases watch time on second viewing

### Tactic 4: User Requests
**Let audience choose stories**:
> "Which mystery should I cover next?
> A) The disappearing hotel
> B) The mountain of bones
> C) The eternal fire
> 
> Comment your choice!"

**Result**: Guaranteed engagement, content ideas for weeks

### Tactic 5: Trend Jacking
**Piggyback on trending topics**:
- If Titanic is trending → "5 Titanic facts they never told you"
- If space news → "The astronaut who saw something impossible"

## ⚠️ Content Guidelines & Ethics

### True Crime Ethics:
- ✅ Focus on solved cases or historical (30+ years old)
- ✅ Be respectful to victims and families
- ✅ Stick to facts, avoid speculation
- ❌ Never glorify criminals
- ❌ Avoid recent tragedies (too sensitive)
- ❌ Don't sensationalize suffering

### Fact-Checking Standards:

## 📈 Analytics Focus (Different Metrics Than AI Channel)
