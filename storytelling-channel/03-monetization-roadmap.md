# Monetization Roadmap - Faceless Storytelling Channel

## 💰 Revenue Philosophy

**Key Insight**: Storytelling channels monetize differently than educational content.

**Why Storytelling is Lucrative**:
- Higher watch time = better YouTube ad revenue
- Mass appeal = larger audience potential  
- Multiple formats = books, podcasts, audiobooks
- Evergreen content = passive income for years

**Monetization Sequence**: Views first → Multiple platforms → Products → Sponsorships
