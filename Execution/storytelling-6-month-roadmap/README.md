## 🚨 Common Questions

**Q: I have no video editing experience. Can I do this?**  
A: YES! Read `COMPLETE-BEGINNER-GUIDE.md`. It assumes zero knowledge.

**Q: What if I don't know what hook/story to use?**  
A: Use `02-MASTER-STORY-DATABASE.md`. All 180 stories have hooks written for you.

**Q: Is 90 min/week realistic?**  
A: Yes. First week takes longer (learning). By week 3, you'll hit 90 min easily.

**Q: Can I use Python automation instead of Canva?**  
A: Yes, but only if you're comfortable with code. See `/scripts/README.md`. Canva is easier.

**Q: What if CapCut is banned in India?**  
A: We use Canva, not CapCut! Canva works perfectly in India.

**Q: Do I need expensive equipment?**  
A: NO! Just a computer with internet. Canva is web-based, stock videos are free.
