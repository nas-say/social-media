## 🎯 The Difference Between Planning & Execution

### Planning Folder:
- **WHY** you're doing this
- **WHAT** the strategy is
- **HOW** it works in theory
- **WHEN** generally to do things

### Execution Folder:
- **EXACTLY WHAT** to post (stories pre-selected)
- **EXACTLY WHEN** to post (dates, times set)
- **EXACTLY HOW** to create it (step-by-step)
- **NO DECISIONS** needed (everything pre-decided)

---

## 🔥 The Promise

**Planning Folder** = 250+ pages of strategy  
**Execution Folder** = Everything you need to just DO IT

**No more**:
- ❌ "What should I post?"
- ❌ "When should I post?"
- ❌ "How do I create this?"
- ❌ "What tools do I need?"

**Just**:
- ✅ Open today's section
- ✅ Follow the steps
- ✅ Create the content
- ✅ Post it
- ✅ Track results

---

## 📝 Notes

- All documents are markdown format (easy to read, edit, print)
- You can customize any part of the execution plan
- The story database gives you 180 stories = 60 days of content (3/day)
- You can repeat/refresh stories after 60 days
- Revenue projections are conservative
- Time estimates are realistic (not "create 100 reels in 1 hour" BS)
